Hey! 👋 Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile. A little bit about me:

* 🎼 I created [Alda] (2012 - present), a music programming language
* 💼 I'm a full-stack Senior Software Engineer at [Kevel] (2014 - present),
  where I've spent the last 9 years creating the UI's, API's, and SDK's that
  have enabled our customers to build their own custom ad servers with minimal
  effort and take back the internet from the ad tech giants.
* 🧠 I'm an expert in Clojure, distributed systems, and creative problem
  solving
* 🎸 I'm a trained musician and I know how to play more instruments than I can
  keep track of 😵‍💫
* ♫ My latest musical endeavor is playing drums in a synth punk band called
  [Trash Signal] _(check us out on your favorite streaming platform!)_.
* 🥋 I have a Combatives belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu

**I'm open to work opportunities!** If you're hiring for a software engineering
role, please have a look at [my resume] and let's get in touch:
