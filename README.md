Hey! 👋 Thanks for stopping by. Here's a little bit about me:

* 🎼 I created [Alda] (2012 - present), a music programming language
* 💼 I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [GovSpend] (2023-). Before that, I was a
  Senior Software Engineer at [Kevel] (2014 - 2023).
* 🧠 I'm an expert in Clojure, distributed systems, and creative problem
  solving
* 🎸 I'm a trained musician and I know how to play more instruments than I can
  keep track of 😵‍💫
* ♫ My latest musical endeavor is playing drums in a synth punk band called
  [Trash Signal] _(check us out on your favorite streaming platform!)_.
* 🥋 I have a blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu
