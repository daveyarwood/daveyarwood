Hey! 👋 Thanks for stopping by. Here's a little bit about me:

* 🎼 I created [Alda] (2012 - present), a music programming language
* 💼 I was a full-stack Senior Software Engineer at [Kevel] (2014 - 2023),
  working on the UI's, API's, and SDK's that enabled customers to build their
  own custom ad servers with minimal effort and take back the internet from the
  ad tech giants.
* 🧠 I'm an expert in Clojure, distributed systems, and creative problem
  solving
* 🎸 I'm a trained musician and I know how to play more instruments than I can
  keep track of 😵‍💫
* ♫ My latest musical endeavor is playing drums in a synth punk band called
  [Trash Signal] _(check us out on your favorite streaming platform!)_.
* 🥋 I have a Combatives belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu

**I'm open to work opportunities!** If you're hiring for a software engineering
role, please have a look at [my resume] and let's get in touch:
